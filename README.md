# pyspark
Getting Started:
Environment Setup: PySpark can be used in Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, or any Python environment. Import the necessary modules (pyspark.sql and pyspark), create a SparkSession, which is your entry point to Spark.

Core Concepts:
SparkContext: This is the entry point for Spark functionality. You can create it using SparkContext in older versions or through SparkSession in newer versions.

DataFrame: Similar to Pandas DataFrames, it's a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. You can perform various operations and transformations on DataFrames.

RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset): This is Spark's fundamental data structure. It's an immutable distributed collection of objects. Though DataFrames are more commonly used due to their optimization and ease of use, RDDs can still be employed for lower-level transformations.

Basic Operations:
Loading Data: PySpark can handle various file formats like CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc. Use spark.read.format('format').load('path') to load data.

Transformations: PySpark offers various transformations like select, filter, groupBy, orderBy, etc., to modify or manipulate DataFrames.

Actions: Actions trigger computation and bring results from transformations. Examples include show, collect, count, save, etc.
